## Notes on Random forest
Notes extracted from: https://carbonati.github.io/posts/random-forests-from-scratch/

Random forests -> Ensemble learning methods used for classification and regression
Advantages:
- Non-parametric (doesn't make assumptions about the data)
- Little to no parameter tuning
- Constructed with basic arithmetic (as opposed to nn that require a lot of mmuls)

Binary Decision Trees -> Structure based on a sequential decision process
- Starts from a root note
- Ask different questions and traverses the tree
